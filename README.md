# Epitech repositories

Hi! I'm Thomas KOEBEL and studies at **EPITECH** Strasbourg. I think it's kind of a shame that all the project done in school doesn't count in my Github stats, that's why this repository exists ! Obviously the code available here doesn't represent my code level nowadays. If I could re code all of this, I would obviously done everything differently.
